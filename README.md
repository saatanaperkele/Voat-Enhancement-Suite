# Voat Enhancement Suite

Voat Enhancement Suite (or VES) is an alpha userscript designed to enhance the user experience of Voat.co.

## Introduction

Voat.co is in alpha development. Many features provided by Reddit Enhancement Suite are already built in to the site's user experience, however there are some features not included (keyboard navigation, new comment highlighting, &c). This userscript is intended to add those features eventually.

A few things:

+ Intended features, as they're decided, are added within `TODO` lines in the userscript source (for now). I'm extremely open to ideas provided by other Voat users as everyone's best experience is priority.
+ Please *do not* install this script if you want a guaranteed seamless Voat experience. Bugs in VES interferring with Voat may be common (or uncommon) depending on many factors.
+ Updates will be pushed out automatically at specific version bumps. Not every commit will be a version bump.

Regardless of VES performance, I hope you enjoy the functionalities VES will provide.

Thank you!
